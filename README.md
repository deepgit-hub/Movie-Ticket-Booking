# 🎬 Theatre Ticket Booking System (Java Console Application)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a console-based Theatre Ticket Booking System developed using Java.

The application allows users to:
- View currently running movies
- Select a movie
- Choose available show timings
- Book seats
- Track seat availability dynamically
- Generate a booking summary

This project was built to improve structured programming, logical thinking, and array-based data handling.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 Dynamic Movie Selection  
- 🖥️ Screen & Ticket Price Display  
- 🎭 2D Array-Based Show Timing Selection  
- 🎟️ Real-Time Seat Availability Tracking  
- 🔁 Continuous Booking System (Loop-Based Flow)  
- ✅ Input Validation  
- 📉 Automatic Seat Reduction After Booking

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

### 🔹 Core Java Concepts
- 1D Arrays
- 2D Arrays
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`)
- Flow Control (`continue`)
- User Input Handling (`Scanner`)

### 🔹 Data Handling Design
- Movies stored using 1D array
- Screens, Prices, and Capacity mapped using parallel arrays
- Show timings implemented using 2D array

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

Initially, this project was implemented using multiple repetitive methods (300+ lines of code).

After refactoring:
- Reduced duplication
- Improved scalability
- Converted logic into structured array-based implementation
- Implemented 2D arrays for dynamic show selection
- Strengthened input validation and logical flow

This project improved my understanding of:
- Structured programming
- Data organization
- Refactoring techniques
- Writing cleaner and scalable code

## 📂 Project Structure

```
practice1.java
```

All logic is implemented using structured arrays and loop-based flow inside the main method.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)
3. Compile:
   ```
   javac practice1.java
   ```
4. Run:
   ```
   java practice1
   ```

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Convert into full OOP-based design (Create `Movie` class)
- Add file handling to store booking history
- Add admin login functionality
- Implement seat layout simulation (2D seat matrix)
- Convert into GUI application (JavaFX / Swing)
